# Info
These are all the exports for macOS and windows.

| File Name | Operating System |
|-----------|------------------|
| macOS.app | macOS (>=12.0.1) |
| win32.exe | windows 32 bit   |
| win64.exe | windows 64 bit   |

Note that I cannot be certain that the windows executables will run.

YOU MAY NEED TO RIGHT-CLICK OPEN THE FILES IF YOU RECIEVE AN ERROR.

# update.sh
This is a macOS/linux shell script to copy an Archive.love (see main README for details) into all the executables, essentially updating them.
